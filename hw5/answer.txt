12.24) The RIO functions all take in a pointer rio_t *rp or char *usrbuf, which
indicates that these functions are not explicitly reentrant.  Thus, they are
implicitly reentrant, wherein the different threads must make sure that their
pointers do not point to any shared memory.  If the different threads accessed
the same memory, then the functions would not be reentrant, but then it is up to
the user to make these functions reentrant; the user must ensure that all
pointers passed in must point to unique memory.  If they did not point to shared
memory these functions are implicitly reentrant, else these functions are
implicitly non-reentrant.
