1) Explain why the instructions in the trace did not produce the correct
mathematical result. Which instructions caused the problem, exactly?

2) Explain why the shell command emacs -batch -eval '(print most-positive-fixnum)'
outputs 2305843009213693951. Where did the number 2305843009213693951 come from?
Explain in terms of the Emacs source code.

3) Explain why the shell command emacs -batch -eval '(print (* most-positive-fixnum
most-positive-fixnum))' outputs only 1.

4) The Emacs executable was compiled with GCC's -O2 option. Suppose it had also
been compiled with -fsanitize=undefined. Explain any problems the trace would
run into, or if there would not be a problem explain why not.

5) Similarly, discuss whether and how -fwrapv would have caused problems.

6) Suppose we assume -fwrapv is used. Suggest changes to how Emacs does integer
multiplication that should help improve its performance. Focus on integer
multiplication; don't alter the machinery Emacs uses to decide which flavor of
multiplication to do.
7) How significant are the efficiency differences discussed above, in the context
of Emacs execution? ''
