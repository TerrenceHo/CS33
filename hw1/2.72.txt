/* Copy integer into buffer if space is available */
/* WARNING: The following code is buggy */

void copy_int(int val, void *buf, int maxbytes) {
    if (maxbytes-sizeof(val) >= 0)
        memcpy(buf, (void *) &val, sizeof(val));
}

A) sizeof(val) returns a size_t, which is an unsigned int.  Thus, the entire
expression is evauluated according to unsigned arithmetic rules, which means
every value is greater than or equal to zero, so the if statement always
evaulates to true the statement is always executed

B) all you need is maxbytes to be greater than sizeof(val), so
if(maxbytes >= sizeof(val)) works.
