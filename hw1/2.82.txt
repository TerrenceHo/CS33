A) (x < y) == (-x > -y)
Not true, because T_MIN * -1 is still equal to T_MIN, so if x == T_MIN and y==1,
(T_MIN < 1) == (T_MIN > -5) is false, which returns 0

B) ((x+y) << 4) + y-x = 17*y + 15*x
((x+y) << 4) = 16*y + 16*x
This is always true.  4 left shifts is equilvalent to multiplying by 16.  There is a danger of losing
the most significant digits, however since they are both the same operation,
then they both end up with the same bits.

C) ~x + ~y + 1 == ~(x + y)
~x = -1 - x, from -x = ~x + 1
-1 - x - 1 - y + 1 == ~(x + y)
-x -y -1 = ~(x+y)
-(x+y) = ~(x + y) + 1
This expression will always return 1 because it is essentially equialvent to the
original two's complement's negation rule -x = ~x + 1.  

D) (ux - uy) == -(unsigned)(y-x)
True, because this is comparing unsigned to a signed int casted to an unsigned, 
so the operation is treated as an unsigned comparison. After you negate the
right hand side the bit patterns for both sides are the same, thus both are 
equal always.

E) ((x >> 2) << 2) <= x
This is always true, because it x was 1000 ... 0000, then shifting two digits to
the right will lose no information, then shifting back to the left two bits will
restore x back to it's original state.  However, even if x was 1000 ... 0011,
shifting right will lose the last two bits, and then shifting left will make x 
1000 ... 0000, which is less than the original x, so the statement still holds
true.

F) x >> 1 == (ux >> 1) + (ux & (-1 << 31))
This is always true.  The signed int is converted to an unsigned int when it is
compared to another unsigned int. (ux & (-1 << 31)) applies a mask to ux to
determine if the most significant digit is a 1.  Right shifts with unsigned
values are logical, so in order to to preserve the most significant value, you
have to add a 1 to the most significant digit using the mask. Assuming right
shift with signed value is arithmentic, this should always equal 1.

G) x % 128 == (x & 127)
127 = 1111111
This is false, because the modulo operator in C is implemented as a remainder
function, which would return negative if x is a negative.  However, x should
never be negative, and x & 127 will often not match up because of this
discrepancy.  For example -5%128 will return -5, whereas -5 & 127 returns 123,
which should be the correct value.
